I created two tables - one labeled "artists" and one labeled "songs". "Artists" contains info on stage name and the artists' real name, along with the corresponding ID. 
"Songs" contains the info of song titles, the year they were released, and has an artist ID that matches the one from the "Artists" table. 

I used the JOIN command to join the tables together to display the stage name of the artist, next to their songs. 

CREATE TABLE artists (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
    stage_name TEXT,
    real_name TEXT
); 

INSERT INTO artists (stage_name, real_name) VALUES ("Lady Gaga", "Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta");
INSERT INTO artists (stage_name, real_name) VALUES ("Britney Spears", "Britney Jean Spears");
INSERT INTO artists (stage_name, real_name) VALUES ("George Michael", "Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou");

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
    artist_id INTEGER,
    title TEXT,
    release_year INTEGER); 
    
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (1, "Free Woman", 2020);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (1, "Just Dance", 2009);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (1, "Heavy Metal Lover", 2011);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (1, "Bad Kids", 2011);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (2, "Breathe On Me", 2004);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (2, "Everytime", 2004);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (2, "Gimme More", 2007);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (2, "Hot As Ice", 2007);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (3, "Fastlove", 1996);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (3, "Father Figure", 1987);  
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (3, "Careless Whisper", 1984);
INSERT INTO songs (artist_id, title, release_year) 
   VALUES (3, "Faith", 1987);

Select * FROM artists;

Select stage_name, title
FROM artists
JOIN Songs
on songs.artist_id = artists.id;
