In this project in my Data Analytics course, we were tasked with working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
The following are queries associated with this dataset.

1) --Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
--Select CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
--FROM chinook.customers
--WHERE Country <> 'USA';

2)--Show only the Customers from Brazil.
--Select CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
--FROM chinook.customers
--WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

3) --Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
--Select customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.invoiceid, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
--FROM chinook.customers customers
--LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices invoices ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.Invoiceid
--WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

4) --Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
--Select * FROM employees
--WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

5)--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
--Select DISTINCT(BillingCountry) 
--FROM invoices
--ORDER BY BillingCountry DESC;

6)--How many Invoices were there in 2009?
--Select COUNT(*) 
--FROM chinook.Invoices
--WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

7)--What are the total sales for 2009?
--SELECT Sum(Total) 
--FROM invoices 
--WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

8)--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID
--select invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name
--FROM tracks
--JOIN invoice_items
--ON tracks.Trackid = invoice_items.Trackid;
